# 04: Initial Experimentation
Test out new models/methods.

# Technical Outputs
- [ ] Jupyter notebooks/python scripts using a small subset of the data
- [ ] Use [ML code template](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/ml-templates) if applicable
- [ ] Confirm the model is working as expected

# Checkpoints
- [ ] Code review within the team (or outside)
    - [ ] Create checklist that reviewers can go through to check technical correctness

# Documentation Outputs
- [ ] Github repo with scripts/notebooks
- [ ] Instructions on how to run (training, evaluation)
- [ ] Documentation of the different model implementations if there was anything particularly difficult to implement (any gotchas) ([Experiment Tracker](../README.md#experiment-tracker))
    - [ ] Runtime
    - [ ] Memory Usage
    - [ ] Size of Data
