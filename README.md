üöÄ A workflow template for Machine Learning (ML) projects that provides the step-by-step ML project checklist as well as the supporting code templates, notebooks, and infrastructure files.

Click on [<kbd>Use this template</kbd>](https://github.com/thinkingmachines/ml-workflow-template/generate) to initialize new repository. Update [Project Resources](#project-resources) section of this README for relevant links in your project. Make sure to update the `Project Name`.

# üîß How to Use this Template

## üìö Links to Resources

The files linked under the [Resources section](#-resources) below serve as **samples** you can use to document certain parts of your ML project. They give a basic outline of the common things noted down when it comes to scoping the project, understanding data tables, tracking experiments, etc. Feel free to modify them as needed.

**In order to use the resources,** make a copy of the files and copy them to your project's Google Drive. Remember to update the links below to refer to your project's copy.

## ‚úÖ The Checklist

The [Workflow Checklist section](#-workflow-checklist) serves as a **guide** to help you determine your next steps at any given stage of your ML project. This template provides a **base or stock** checklist that you can use as is. Feel free to add items as needed.

**In order to mark an item as done,** you need to edit the `.md` file in Github (or in your IDE of choice) then change the checkbox from:

`[ ]` to `[X]`

## üì¶ Dependencies
- The repo uses [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) to manage project dependencies.

### Before development (one-time setup)
1. To install Poetry system-wide on Linux, run the following on your terminal:
    ```bash
    curl -sSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/python-poetry/poetry/master/install-poetry.py | python3 -
    ```
   For other operating systems, check the steps on the [Poetry
   repo](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry#installation).
1. Update your project's metadata. In `pyproject.toml`, update the `name`, `description`, and `authors` fields.
1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:
    ```bash
    make dev
    ```
    Poetry will automatically create a virtual environment inside `.venv/` &ndash; you do *not* need to initialize your own!

1. Activate the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    ```

### During development
- To add dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry add <dependency>
    ```

- To update dependencies:
    ```bash
    poetry update
    ```

- Find other workflows and FAQs at the [Poetry TM wiki](https://wiki.tm8.dev/doc/poetry-exIJa15ukh).

### Dependabot
The repo uses the [dependabot](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/supply-chain-security/keeping-your-dependencies-updated-automatically/enabling-and-disabling-version-updates)
integration in Github to keep packages updated. To disable the integration, delete `.github/dependabot.yml`. Dependabot will check for version updates daily and will file PRs when updates are available.

### Other Notes
Do not delete or modify the [`.github.tracking`](.github.tracking) file. This file is used to check what repos have used the ML workflow template.

## üìä DVC Setup

To install DVC and set up your remote storage, make sure you have setup the project and GCP name in `.env`.
Run:
```
make dvc
```
*This has to be done only once.*

More information on DVC [here](https://wiki.tm8.dev/doc/data-version-control-dvc-lMqfvLWuCa).

## üîÑ Getting the Latest Updates

If your project uses this repository as a template, you can pull the latest ML Workflow Template updates by performing the following steps.

1. **In your project's repository**, create a temporary branch `merge-template-updates` (or any other branch name you deem appropriate) from your repository's `main` or `master` branch.
    ```
    git checkout -b merge-template-updates
    ```
1. Add `ml-workflow-template` as a remote.
    ```
    git remote add ml-workflow-template git@github.com:thinkingmachines/ml-workflow-template.git
    ```
1. Fetch latest updates from ML Workflow Template using the remote that was just added.
    ```
    git fetch ml-workflow-template
    ```
1. Merge in the latest updates and fix conflicts if any.
    ```
    git merge --allow-unrelated-histories --squash ml-workflow-template/main
    ```
1. Create a pull request from `merge-template-updates` to `main` or `master`.
